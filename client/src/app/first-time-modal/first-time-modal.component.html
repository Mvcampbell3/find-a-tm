        Feel free to check out what we've got. When you are ready to start adding games to your profile, you need to
        make sure you have added game platforms first. Head to your profile page and you can add them there. Once you
        have done that, you will be able to add any game that is playable on the platforms you have added to your
        profile.</p>
